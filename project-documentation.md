# Project Documentation


# Week by Week/ Milestone wise progress

## **Milestone 1**:- Foundation/Basics
### Task :- Python file operations for document handling and LLM prompt engineering excercises.
1) Basic python programming and some Machine Learning basics like Supervised and Unsupervised models.
2) Explored the LLM models like [Groq](https://console.groq.com/playground).
3) In the Groq playground, experimented with various models, system and user prompts and parameters like temperature and max completion tokens. 
4) Implementing [Streamlit API](https://streamlit.io/) (Create tabs, headings).


## **Milestone 2**:- Advanced Concept Development
### Task :- Implement Basic vector database operations and create a interface for summary tab.
1) Understanding what RAG systems are, and its architecture.
2) Implementing vector databases in our project like [FAISS](https://ai.meta.com/tools/faiss/) (Facebook AI similary search).
3) Use [Groq](https://console.groq.com/playground) for summarizing a legal doc which user inputs into the [Streamlit UI](https://streamlit.io/).


## **Milestone 3**:- Advanced Concept Development
### Task :- Document Processing and Risk Detection.
1) Implement Chatbot with the help of prompts in [Groq](https://console.groq.com/playground).
2) Deploy LLMs for clause extractions.
3) Develop Risk Scoring Algorithms (severity + likelihood)
4) Integrate compliance checklists (GDPR/HIPAA).

## **Milestone 4**:- Full Integration and Deployment.
### Task :- Achieve full system integration and prepare for deployment.
1) Connect analysis modules to streamlit.
2) Attach visualisations for risk assessment.
3) Use [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) for deployment.
4) In hugging face, set up environment variables in the secrets tab, this is where all the api keys are kept
5) Integrate email automation using [Sendgrid](https://sendgrid.com/en-us), where the user inputs his/her email address and then the downloadable pdfs are sent to the inputted email address.
6) After all the functionalities are setup, deploy the model on hugging face.
